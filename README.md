# Demo-2
Demo-2 for Group 007 in SEED Lab

__Purpose of Repository__
This repository contains code and Aruco markers for Demo-2 for SEED Lab. This code for both Arduino and 
Raspberry Pi programs a constructed robot to turn in place until a PiCamera detects an Aruco marker, then
approach the beacon within one foot, and drive in a circle around the beacon, travelling no further than two
feet away from it.
